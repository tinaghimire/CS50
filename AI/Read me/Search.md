# CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

## Introduction
In today's world, Artificial intelligence is getting popular in every fields possible. To explore Artificial Intelligence with python, CS50 course is one of the great choice. I am learning this course through edx and will keep on adding information regarding the course.
**Hope you enjoy!**

Following topics are discussed within CS50 AI 2023:
1. Search
2. Knowledge
3. Uncertainty
4. Optimization
5. Learning
6. Neural Network 
7. Language(new)

**Let's get started**

## Lecture-1     **Search**
Searching can help find a shortest connected path between two points or find a solution. A agent begins from a initial state, and performs some actions to get to a goal. Performing action a in state s results into a change in state. 

### Search Problem
1. Initial state
2. Actions
3. Transition model 
   - Result of the action
4. Goal test
   - To check whether a given state is the required goal.
5. Path cost function
   - Function determining the numerical cost associated with a given path.

For the better results, a solution should have the lowest cost among all solution which is known as **Optimal solution**.

### Node
A data structure that keeps track of state, previous node, an action and a path cost is known as node.

### Search Approach
